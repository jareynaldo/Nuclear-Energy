                Although it's a very intimidating word and phrase, Nuclear Energy simply refers to the energy that
                is used inside of an atom's nucleus. This sets it apart from most other chemical interactions, as most simply 
                deal with an atom's valance electrons and not interactions within the nucleus of an atom.

            </p>
            <p class="small">
              Due to the Strong Nuclear Force's lessened abilities over larger nuclei, it becomes much easier to tear that nucleus 
              apart the bigger it becomes. This is what ultimately sets the atom's stability.
            </p>

            </a>
            <p class="small">
              Well once we know what keeps the nucleus together, we can much easier understand how to take them apart.
            </p>
            <p class="small">
              The chart above illustrates the relationship between the number of protons to neutrons. As we can see, the larger the amount of 
              protons, the larger the number of neutrons that are needed to cancel out the proton's repulsion force. 
            </p>
            <p class="small">
              This means that the larger the nucleus, the more unstable it is, and the easier it is for the element to decay.

              Since we know that larger nuclei are easier to take apart, we must have a way to describe that process.

              An Atoms decay is exactly that, the way the atom has to get rid of this excess energy and nucleons. It comes in three types, 
              Alpha, Beta, And Gamma (with their respective strengths shown above).

                First of all, U is simply a unit to calculate the mass in microscopic ranges, called Unified Atomic Mass Unit, which is equal to 
                1.6605 x 10<sup>-27</sup> Kg. The blue unit in the picture (top), is the mass of the entire nucleus of a Helium atom. While the green unit 
                (bottom) is the mass of each individual nucleon added together. Why is there more mass when added individually than as a whole? Well since 
                we know that E=mc<sup>2</sup>, we can rationally assume that the excess energy is simply binding energy.

                <p class="card-text small">
                  This type of decay occurs because the parent nucleus is too large and the Strong Nuclear Force is no longer 
                  strong enough to hold all of the nucleons together.

                <p class="card-text small">
                  Due to this instability, the nucleus must try to make itself smaller. It tries this by shedding two neutrons and two 
                  protons, what we call an alpha particle. This alpha particle is actually just a helium atom and is the 
                  same particle that Rutherford shot at a gold foil and discovered the Atoms nucleus.

                  This type of decay usually happens when a nucleus has too many protons or neutrons. Here the atom will shed either a 
                  negative or positively charged beta particle (an electron) and a negatively or positively charged neutrino (a neutrally
                  charged particle). Although an electron and antineutrino combo is far more common.

                <p class="card-text small">
                  Originally the neutrino hadn't been included in the Beta Decay process. It wasn't until energy levels were measured in 
                  the decay and large fluctuations were found, leading to the idea that another particle must be carrying away this extra energy, 
                  the neutrino.

                  Gamma Decay happens when a nucleus emits high-powered photons, in what is known as gamma rays. This is different from 
                  other types of decay as it's actually a (very energetic) wave and not a particle.
                </p>
                <p class="card-text small">
                  This usually happens when the nucleus is decaying from a larger form and is in an excited state, or because it just 
                 collided with a very high-energy particle among other reasons.
